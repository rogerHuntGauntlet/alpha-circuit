# Circuit - Intelligent Gaming Matchmaking Platform

Circuit is an advanced matchmaking platform that uses machine learning to enhance player experiences through intelligent social matching and behavioral analysis.

## Overview

Circuit provides gaming companies with powerful APIs to match players based on compatibility factors including:
- Personality and communication style
- Voice analysis and emotional patterns
- Gaming preferences and behaviors
- Time patterns and availability
- Content tolerance and language preferences

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Matching**: Create optimized groups based on multiple compatibility factors
- **Voice Analysis**: Track emotional states, toxicity, and engagement through voice patterns
- **Behavioral Tracking**: Analyze player interactions and preferences over time
- **Health-Focused Design**: Promote healthy gaming habits through session monitoring
- **Comprehensive API**: Easy integration with existing gaming platforms

## Technical Stack

Circuit is built with modern web technologies for performance, scalability, and developer experience:

- **Frontend Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React-based framework)
- **Hosting Platform**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Machine Learning**: [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/)
- **Database**: Vercel KV (Redis) for caching, Postgres for persistent data
- **Authentication**: [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Implementation Approach

The platform is developed using a phased approach:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Authentication, API structure, database schema
2. **Base Functionality**: Profile management, basic matching algorithm
3. **Advanced Features**: Voice analysis, machine learning components
4. **Optimization**: Performance tuning, scaling, monitoring

OpenAI's API is leveraged for key machine learning components:
- Text embeddings for profile matching
- GPT models for personality analysis
- Whisper for voice transcription and analysis
- Content moderation for toxicity detection
